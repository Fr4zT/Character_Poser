# Character_Poser
 
Character Poser is a tool made in Unity 3D to create reference poses that can be used by artists. This tool allows you to rotate the articulations of a dummy to create poses. You can also save these poses as files for later uses.

This is one of the first personal projects I made in Unity in 2021, so the code and project setup are probably bad. The project is 100% open source. Feel free to fork the repo and make your own version of the software.

The project uses version 2021.3.9f1.
